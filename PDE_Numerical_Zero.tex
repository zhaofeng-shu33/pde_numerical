\title{Solving Symplectic Problem}

\maketitle
I use Midpoint to solve the problem with the stepsize $h=0.1$.
One is explicit Midpoint and the other is implicit.
The evolution of the energy $\frac{p^2+q^2}{2}$ is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:e}. It can be seen that
the energy obtained explicit Midpoint at each time steps diverges gradually
while that of implicit Midpoint is preserved.

Though implicit midpoint can preserve the energy much better,
the global error is still accumulated as time passes by.
This error comes from the phase delay, which is shown more clearly
if when choose $T=1000$ (See Fig \ref{fig:o}).

    the orange one is the numerical solution.}
